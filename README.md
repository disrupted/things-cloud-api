# Things Cloud Python client

> work in progress, expect breaking changes

Things is an excellent to-do manager for Apple devices, specifically the Mac, iPad, iPhone and Watch. Unfortunately there is no support outside these devices. Like many other users, I encountered this limitation after spending years using Things daily to plan nearly every aspect of my life and work.

This is an attempt of recreating some basic functionality Things Cloud has to offer, to help automate some recurring tasks (e.g. inside of Home Assistant).

Since there's no documentation, I've been analyzing the requests made by the Mac app. The exchanged data is often difficult to understand, because none of the fields use clear names. So far, figuring out the meaning of the to-do item fields, has been a mixed success. I was able to document some fields, while others remain a mystery.

Contributions are welcome to translate the rest of the fields.

## Usage

```python
from things_cloud import ThingsClient
from things_cloud.models import TodoItem

ACCOUNT = "<your-account-id>"
# current head index of Cloud database (if you know it)
OFFSET = 1234
# otherwise
OFFSET = None

things = ThingsClient(ACCOUNT, initial_offset=OFFSET)
# create a new project
project = TodoItem(title="Things Cloud Project").as_project()
# push to Things Cloud
things.commit(project)

# create a todo inside project
todo = TodoItem(title="Try out Things Cloud")
todo.project = project
things.commit(todo)

# schedule for today
todo.today()
things.commit(todo)
```

See [main.py](main.py).
